// lets start over just to see how github works :)


// ### 1. Data types

// #### Refresher

// So far we have seen:

// * Strings
// * Numbers
// * Booleans
// * Arrays
// * Objects

// When these datatypes are combined, we get a **data structure**, for example,
// an array that contains objects that each contain booleans.

// Suppose you are tasked with creating some software, and it is up to **you**
// to determine which datatypes and what data structure to use.  For each of the following,
// write which **data types** you would use to represent the data, and then give a small example of the 
//**data structure**:

//   * A light switch that can be either on or off.
//   * A user's email address.
//   * A spaceship with a hull, laser blasters, tractor beam, and warp drive.
//   * A list of student names from our class.
//   * A list of student names from our class, each with a location.
//   * A list of student names from our class, each with a location and each with a list of favorite tv shows.



    //lightSwitch: ['on', 'off'],  Booleans
    const lightSwitch = (on) => {
        if (input === "1") return On;
        return Off;
      };
      lightSwitch('1')    
      lightSwitch('0')

      //Students Name: Array
      const nameOfStudents = ['steve', 'bob', 'isabella', 'James']
        console.log(nameOfStudents)

      // Students name, location and favorite tv show : object
      const   studentInfo = {
               info [
                 {
                   name: 
                   location: 
                   favoriteTvShow:
                 }
                 {
                    name:
                    location:
                    favoriteTvShow:
                  }
                ]
